            <p>My professional life began as an actor and musician, working in theaters from Vermont to California, and teaching the arts and early childhood education along the way. After freelancing with several clients and colleagues to design their websites, I realized I was drawn to tech because of its potential to benefit existing industries as they adapt and respond to contemporary culture -- so I learned to code!</p>

            <p id="about-p2">What makes me a good artist and teacher is what makes me a good engineer: <span>the willingness to experiment and improvise, a commitment to my team, and a desire to collaborate towards something great.</span></p>
