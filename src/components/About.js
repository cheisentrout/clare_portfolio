            <p id="about-p1">My professional life began as an <a href="https://www.clareheisentrout.com/" target="https://www.clareheisentrout.com/">actor</a> and <a href="https://www.claxyclaxy.com/" target="https://www.claxyclaxy.com/">musician</a>, working in theaters from Vermont to California, and teaching the arts and early childhood education along the way. After freelancing with several <a href="https://www.cambridgebiotherapies.com/" target="https://www.cambridgebiotherapies.com/">clients and colleagues</a> to design their websites, I realized I was drawn to tech because of its potential to benefit existing industries as they adapt and respond to contemporary culture -- so I learned to code!</p>

            <p id="about-p2">What makes me a good artist and teacher is what makes me a good engineer: <span>the willingness to experiment and improvise, a commitment to my team, and a desire to collaborate together towards something great.</span></p>
